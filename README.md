Forge SSH Assistant is a CLI tool built with [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com) that fetches your Laravel Forge servers and lists these in a menu so you can easily choose which server you want to SSH into.

With Forge SSH Assistant you don't have to open Laravel Forge to check the IP address of the server(s) you want to work with. 

You don't have to maintain aliases on every machine you use for development, for each server you have on Laravel Forge.

All Forge SSH Assistant needs is a valid Laravel Forge token to be able to access your Laravel Forge account 
and Forge SSH Assistant will take care of the rest.
